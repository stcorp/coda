                CODA 2.25.2 Release Notes


CODA is the Common Data Access framework that allows reading of scientific data
from various data formats, including structured ascii, structured binary, XML,
netCDF, CDF, HDF4, HDF5, GRIB, RINEX and SP3. It provides a single consistent
hierarchical view on data independent of the underlying storage format.

CODA is used as a core component in various ESA software among which the ESA
Atmospheric Toolbox (BEAT) and the Broadview Radar Altimetry Toolbox (BRAT).

The CODA software package comes with interfaces for C, Fortran, IDL, MATLAB,
Python, and Java and several useful command-line tools.

In order to make use of the data reading facilities of CODA, you will need to
have the CODA product format definition files (.codadef files) for the data
products that you want to access. It is important to note that the CODA
software package does not come with any product format definition files itself!
The get access to .codadef files have a look at the software packages that make
use of CODA.

For files in netCDF, CDF, HDF4, HDF5, GRIB, RINEX, or SP3 format you can use
CODA without any .codadef files, since for these formats CODA either comes with
a built in definition of the format or CODA determines the format from the file
itself.
