      <p>This documentation describes the functionality of the codacheck tool which is part of CODA.</p>
    
      <h2 id="general">General description</h2>

      <p>The product format definitions in CODA should be of sufficient quality that whenever problems are detected while reading product files, it is usually the product files that are at fault. The codacheck program was written with this in mind. It uses CODA as an active product file problem-detection tool. It takes as arguments one or more product files. CODA will try to open each of these files and will actively look for any problems in these files. Any errors are reported in a user-readable way.</p>

<pre>
    codacheck [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;files&gt;
        Provide a basic sanity check on product files supported by CODA
        Options:
            -d, --definition
                    require products to have a definition in a codadef file,
                    return an error and abort verification otherwise
                    (affects products using formats such as xml/netcdf/hdf)
            -q, --quick
                    only perform a quick check of the product
                    (do not traverse the full product)
            -V, --verbose
                    show more information while performing the check

            --no-mmap
                    disable the use of mmap when opening files

        If you pass a '-' for the &lt;files&gt; section then the list of files will
        be read from stdin.

    codacheck -h, --help
        Show help (this text)

    codacheck -v, --version
        Print the version number of CODA and exit
