/* This hashtable is a special hash table in which 'name' is the key and 'index' is the value.
 * The index is the 0-based index that represents the order in which the names were added to the hash table.
 * In other words, the first name that gets added to the hashtable will have index value 0, the second name will
 * have index value 1, etc.
 * Mind that the hashtable does not create a copy of the 'name' string, so you should keep a reference of this
 * string active until after you have called delete_hashtable().
