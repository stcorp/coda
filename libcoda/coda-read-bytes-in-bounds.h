/* be careful not to bypass this function and try to access mem_ptr directly by casting its contents to
 * e.g. int16, int32, etc. This will not work since many platforms require these types of data to start
 * at a word aligned boundary memory address.
 * For such data types to be read from mem_ptr, you will first have to copy the value into a proper
 * word aligned memory address (which is the pointer you pass as 'dst').
 * Accessing data as a char array from mem_ptr can however be done safely (and can thus potentially be
 * done without using this function, if there is a need for it).
